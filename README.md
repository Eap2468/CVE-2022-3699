# CVE-2022-3699
Proof of Concept exploit for CVE-2022-3699

Exploit tested on Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.4651

Vulnerability deals with allowing unprivileged users to access functionality that lets you read and write from physical memory from the instance of the kernel, however since the primitives deal with physical memory there's a bit of extra work needed to weaponize it

Stole the idea for getting the virtual read primitive from alfarom256 who got it from ch3rn0byl
